# üèóÔ∏è scaf

> A simple tool for scaffolding Advent of Code tasks

## ü§î Why Scaf?

[**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com) is fun, but setting up tasks every day can be tedious. **scaf** simplifies this by automating the setup, letting you focus on solving puzzles. It does this by fetching task info directly from the website and creating a directory structure and files for the task, including the input data file. 
You can select from [multiple languages](./src/templates/), as long as there is a template for that.

## üöÄ Usage

### Installation

Install **scaf** globally using npm to make it accessible as a CLI tool:

```bash
npm install -g @szymmis/scaf
```

### Setting AoC API key

- Go to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/auth/login) website and login
- Open browser devtools and copy `session` cookie value
- Set env variable `AOC_API_KEY=<value>` in your shell

### Scaffolding a task

Use the **init** command to create a new task's folder and files for a specific day and programming language:

```bash
scaf init <lang> <year>/<day>
```

- `lang`: The programming language you want to use (e.g., `go`, `rust`, `py`).
- `year/day`: The Advent of Code year and day to scaffold (e.g., `2023/01`).

### Advancing to the second part

When you‚Äôre ready to tackle part two of the day's puzzle, use the `advance` command:

```bash
scaf advance <year/day>
```

- `year/day`: The year and day of the task you're advancing (e.g., `2023/01`).

This command generates the necessary files or updates your workspace to prepare for solving part two.
